                        <p class="field">Hi, my name is Krish Nalam and I am a grade 11 student with a passion for
                            coding
                            and technology.
                            I have always been interested in how computers work and love the challenge of solving
                            complex
                            problems through programming. Over the past few years I have both recieved external
                            training, as
                            well as taught my self several programming languages, including Python, Java and C#. I
                            have
                            also
                            used these languages to create games and worked on many projects. My dream is to pursue
                            a
                            career
                            in computer science, and I am currently working on developing my skills in web
                            development
                            and
                            mobile app development using html, css and Javascript. I am also an active member of my
                            school's
                            coding club and have participated in coding competitions, where I have gained valuable
                            experience.

                        <p>As the founder and president of our chess club, I helped create a website to promote our
                            club
                            and organized a successful

                            different
                            schools in a friendly and
                            competitive atmosphere. Up till today, I continue to promote chess in my community and
                            inspire new players to join this
                            passionate community.</p>

                        <p>As a DECA student who participated in BDLTM, the competition was a rewarding experience.
                            My
                            team received a case study
                            where a company was facing financial difficulties and we had to create a strategy to
                            turn
                            things around. We presented
                            our ideas to judges in a simulated business meeting. Making it to provincials was a
                            great
                            achievement and I learned
                            valuable skills such as teamwork, critical thinking, and presentation skills that will
                            be
